## What's Relevant for Buffer

Buffer is looking for someone who:
- Thinks in systems, not tasks
- Builds with AI and automation tools (n8n, Make, Zapier, Notion, Slack)
- Can own documentation, tooling, and operational health
- Thrives in async, remote, global environments
- Bridges technical and people/ops work

Luis maps to this because:
- He already works remotely across time zones as a contractor
- He builds real automation (not just talks about it) — Python scripts, AI workflows, Chrome extensions
- His QA background = systems thinking, edge cases, process rigor
- His martech stack experience = familiarity with the kind of tool complexity Buffer manages
- His side projects = proof he ships independently without hand-holding

#### Why Buffer Section *(optional but powerful)*
A short, direct paragraph explaining why Buffer specifically — not just "a remote company." Reference their transparency culture, async-first approach, and the specific systems work in the JD. This shows you did the homework.

Example:
> "Buffer's commitment to radical transparency and async-first operations isn't a perk for me — it's how I already work. I'm drawn to this role because it's rare to find a company that treats operational clarity as a product, not an afterthought."

#### Contact / Application Section
Simple: name, link to LinkedIn, link to GitHub (if public), email, and a direct note that this site was built for the Buffer application.
